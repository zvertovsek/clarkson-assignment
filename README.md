This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The assignment is coded as a webpage. Install and run the development server to get it up and running. Select the one of the 
four tasks in top navigation bar. For Tree traversal and Dom Styling tasks, there is nothing to see really as a webpage, but i have written some tests around the tasks, so I could work on them. <br /><br />
Hope you will like it!
